# Skip Links aka Bypass Links

[Bypass Links](https://ssit.scl.cornell.edu/web-accessibility/how/basics)

All pages must have a mechanism to bypass repeated content - Skip navigation/Skip to main content.

## Implementations

The skip-link is hidden until to the user navigates to it with a keyboard.

To be usable by all keyboard users, particularly sighted keyboard users, the link must:

- be hidden by default
- be accessible to keyboard navigation
- become prominently visible when it is focused
- properly set focus to the main content area when activated

## Usage

by default the skip link will not be visable unless the user navigates to it with a keyboard.

Click on this page then press tab to navigate to the hidden link. When the link is focused it will become visible.
