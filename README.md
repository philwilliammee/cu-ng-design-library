link to the [StackBlitz demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-j8ckge?devToolsHeight=33&file=src/app/app.component.ts)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5.

## Development server (this doesn't work looks like the library was never intended to be used like this)

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Storybook

1. Run `npm run storybook` to start the storybook server. Navigate to `http://localhost:6006/`.
2. Run `npm run watch` to build the library and watch for changes.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publish package on NPM

Run `npm run publish` to publish the project to NPM.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
